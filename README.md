# Empathic-Accuracy
This data was collected from user interview sessions. The empathic accuracy dyadic interaction paradigm approach was used to carry out the empathic task. This approach evaluates the designer’s empathic understanding ability with respect to the specific user in the specific user interview. That is, the designer’s empathic user understanding was measured based on the user interview they partook in.
